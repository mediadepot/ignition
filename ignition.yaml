# This is the main CoreOS Ignition file for "installing" Mediadepot.
# It contains configuration that should be customized for each installation (SSH keys, Disk drives, etc.)
# All other configuration is stored in the ignition.d directory and loaded as modules.
# These configuration files are heavily commented for ease of use
#
# Ignition configuration files are written in YAML, following the syntax shown here:
#   https://github.com/coreos/container-linux-config-transpiler/blob/master/doc/configuration.md
# The Ignition YAML files are then "transpiled" to JSON using the CoreOS Configuration Transpiler:
#   https://github.com/coreos/container-linux-config-transpiler
#

    append:
    # (Required) The base.json config prepares the filesystem and sets up disk mounting service.
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/base.json

    # (Required) The mergerfs.json config installs the mergerfs binary and sets up the automation friendly folder structure
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/mergerfs.json

    # (Required) The portainer.json config installs a Portainer service, which manages a Docker container.
    # Portainer is used for managing docker containers via a Web UI.
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/portainer.json

    # (Required) The traefik.json config installs a Traefik service, which manages a Docker container.
    # Traefik is used to automatically provide a easy-to-remember hostname for each docker container.
    # eg. sickrage.depot.lan or home.depot.lan
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/traefik.json

    # (Optional) The dnsmasq.json config installs a Dnsmasq service, which manages a Docker container.
    # DNSMasq is a light-weight DNS server configured to route all *.depot.lan requests to the traefik container.
    # All other requests are routed via Google DNS. This means you can configure your other computers to use
    # DNSMasq as your primary DNS and access the internet and the services running on your Mediadepot server, without any issues.
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/dnsmasq.json

    # (Optional) The samba.json config installs a Samba service, which manages a Docker container.
    # Samba exposes the storage folder structure as network shares
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/samba.json

    # (Optional) The notifications.json config sets up a configuration file for enabling PushOver notifications (used by SmartMonTools & System Startup/Shutdown notifications)
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/notifications.json

    # (Optional) The fs-monitor.json installs a SmartMonTools service, which manages a Docker container.
    # SmartMonTools tracks the S.M.A.R.T. health status of your disk drives and notifies you if your disk health changes.
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/fs-monitor.json

    # (Optional) The netdata.json installs a NetData service, which manages a Docker container.
    # Netdata is a lightweight metric logging service that shows you the current utilization of your server (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc)
    - source: https://mediadepot.github.io/ignition/ignition.d/netdata.json

# (Required) The users defined in this section are required (core & depot).
# `core` is the default user for the CoreOS installation.
# It's the user you will use for making changes as root, via sudo.
#
# `depot` is a limited user account, which owns all of your media files. It's uid/gid must be 15000.
#
# You should change the ssh_authorized_keys for both users to a key under your control.
